# AI Tic-Tac-Toe Project (CENG 3511)

This is my midterm project for the CENG 3511 Artificial Intelligence course.

It's a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against an unbeatable computer AI.

### About the Game
* **Player:** You play as 'x'.
* **AI:** The computer plays as 'o'.
* **AI Method:** The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**. This algorithm allows the AI to look at all possible future moves and choose the optimal one.
* **Result:** It's impossible to beat the AI. The best you can achieve is a draw!

### How to Play
1.  You need **Python 3** installed.
2.  Download the `.py` file.
3.  Open your terminal (command line) and run the script:

    ```
    python tictactoe.py
    ```
4.  Type a number (1-9) to make your move when it's your turn.
