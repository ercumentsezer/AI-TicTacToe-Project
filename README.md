AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is my class project for AI.

It's the Tic-Tac-Toe game, but you play against a smart computer AI.

About the Game
You play as 'x'.

The computer plays as 'o'.

The computer uses the Minimax algorithm, so it knows the best move.

It's impossible to beat the AI. The best you can get is a draw!

How to Play
You need Python 3.

Save the tictactoe.py file.

Open your terminal and run it:

python tictactoe.py
Type a number (1-9) to make your move.
